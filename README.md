# my-notes
Hello my name is muhye aldeen
## im an electicral engineer 
i was graduated from BAU 
and im happy to to share this first repo for me ^_^ .  


# I learned from this paragraph some things:
1- 	All developers must understand and know what the application or website must help the user not being hard to use as possible as they can.

2-	Developers should always learn new things about their language or other languages and must be clear with this point and ask about all things.

3-	Must be from all developers to manage his time that will help him to fix any of part in his code well, and to maintain his code so fast as possible as he can, I think he can do that when he manages his time so that so important thing.

4-	To solve a problem do not give up so fast on it, keep going and sleep on your problem and if you can’t solve it, you must ask for help after that and think before doing any action.

5-	Do not get involved in assumptions that you do not need because it may waste time on things that you do not need as a developer.

6-	Not many lines in your code that mean the software is being better, make it simple as you can to fix it after you finish and don’t meager that in your mind if I have so many lines that’s mean better. 

7-	 Testing is a very important thing for developers, must as the good developers you have the stages of testing your code to avoid problems later.

8-	The documentation part of your code must help you in the later to know why I write this code in this way and what this line doing.
